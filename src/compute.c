 * @ Description: Alloc command buffer in command pool and submit queue. Create
 * descriptor set for buffers.
 * 
 * commandPool means where to allocate the command buffer, 
 * which aren't allocated individually.
 * 
 * VkCommandBufferBeginInfo records operations that want to be executed.
 * 
 * static var command_buff_begin_info means that commandBuffer is intented
 * to be used once and reset afterwards.
 * 
 * Now with vkCmdDispatch can record various operations to the command buffer 
 * and run shader in many parallel runs,
 * can set how many groups of shader groups should be start.
 * Each run has its own index, which also helps to find which part of the data
 * belongs to the particular run.
 * vkCmdDispatch has 3 dimensions, which determinate how many groups in each
 * dimension should run. Each dimension(x y z) indicates number of indexes, 
 * and therese values multiplied results in the number of groups that will run.
